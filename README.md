Our team developed a Hospital Management System, a desktop application designed to streamline hospital operations and improve efficiency. Built using Java Swing for the user interface and MySQL (JDBC) for database management, this application facilitates seamless management of patient records, ambulance services, room allocations, and comprehensive oversight of medical departments, including surgery, nursing, and general care.
The system ensures secure database integration, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval. Its intuitive UI prioritizes responsiveness and user-friendly navigation, enhancing operational workflow for hospital administrators and staff.
